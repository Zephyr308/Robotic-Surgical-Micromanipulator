# Enhancing Robotic Micromanipulators with Compliant Mechanisms for Surgical Applications

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project explores a novel integration of **adaptive compliant grippers** with a **parallel wrist transmission system**, designed to improve the **dexterity**, **safety**, and **precision** of surgical robotic manipulators.

The aim is to enable more **natural and intuitive control** of surgical instruments, enhancing the surgeon’s ability to perform delicate procedures while reducing the risk of tissue damage and improving patient outcomes.
