# 🧪 Experimental Testing & Results

This file documents the evaluation of the compliant gripper and wrist system, focusing on adaptability, contact force regulation, and range of motion performance.

## 📌 1. Gripper Adaptability Test

**Purpose:**  
To validate the gripper’s ability to passively adapt to different object shapes and sizes using compliant mechanics. An additional overload force was applied to test the contact force behavior and structural integrity.

## ⚙️ 2. Constant-Force Mechanism (CFM)

The compliant mechanism includes a **constant-force mechanism**, designed to output near-constant contact force across a range of displacements — critical for safe manipulation in surgical tasks.

**Applications:**  
- Overload protection  
- Soft-tissue manipulation  
- Polishing and deburring

**Performance Range:**

- **Contact Force Output:** ≈ **3.1 N – 6.8 N**
- **Design Goal:**  
  Maintain a **nearly constant force** across a broad displacement range with **minimal variation**.

## 📐 3. Range of Motion (RoM) Characterization

**Purpose:**  
To measure the operational range of the integrated wrist-gripper system in free space.
